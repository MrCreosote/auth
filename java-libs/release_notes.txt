OVERVIEW
--------

Java client for the KBase authorization service (and Globus Online directly
where the KBase auth service doesn't yet have the required functionality).
See the versions file for a mapping of git commit -> version.

VERSION 0.2.0 (Released 4/8/15)
------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES
- The auth client is now instantiable rather than static.
- The auth client may now be configured with endpoint URLs and the Globus group
  to query for users.
- The client can now produce a token that refreshes itself periodically.
- The client can be configured with a token to use for all user queries. In
  most cases this should be an administrator of the kbase group, since if users
  set their profiles to private they are invisible to standard users.

UPDATED FEATURES / BUG FIXES
- Fix tests to deal with kbasetest user status changes.
- Account for change in Globus token lifetime (-1 day).
- Use alternative API to get user details since the current API no longer
  works the way we use it. The new API was recommended by Globus.
- Users outside of the kbase_users group will now no longer show up in user
  validation or details queries.

VERSION 0.1.0 (Released 4/25/2014)

(kbase-auth-1398468950-3552bb2.jar).
No release notes existed at this point, so this version will serve as the 
baseline for future changes.
